## Python Projects
*This is a collection of Python projects that I completed during my study and instruction at The Tech Academy.*

These are my solutions to the major exercises presented to the students.  And I believe these showcase my understanding of Python and my creativity in problem solving.

### Content Descriptions:
* __C10Sec8-9Drill__
    * Python 3.4
    * tKinter built GUI
    * Script creates simple HTML files based on either user input or pre-made content stored in a SQLite Database
    * the GUI allows users to save their input as pre-made content to the database
* __C10Sec8-7Drill__
    * Python 3.4
    * tKinter built GUI
    * Script will move files from one folder to another using a saved timestamp from the previous file transfer
    * the GUI allows users to select both the source and destination folders and provides feedback about the transfer
    * a timestamp is saved whenever a file transfer is performed using a SQLite Database
* __C10Sec8-5Drill__
    * Python 2.7
    * wxPython built GUI
    * Script is similar to the 8-7Drill above...just written in Python 2.7
* __C10Sec8-1Drill__
    * Python 2.7
    * CLI (Shell)
    * Script will take the current time in Portland, OR, and determine what the local time is in New York and London
    * Script will determine if either the New York office or London office is closed
    * I attempted a second version of this script to practice classes and timezone objects...still in progress...
* 08-01 project_rs.py
    * Python 3.4
    * tKinter GUI
    * this exercise was about gaining familiarity with tKinter widgets and layout/GUI design
