## C# and ASP.NET Projects
#### These are my solutions to the different "challenges" presented to us during the coursework at the Tech Academy.
The challenges come from Bob Tabor's *C# Fundamentals via ASP.NET Web Applications* video course on his website: www.learnvisualstudio.net.
##### *All of these folders contain my MS VisualStudio (2013 Community) solutions for the different challenges*
