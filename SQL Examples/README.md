## SQL Examples
This is an example database that I created for a project to practice making SQL queries.  The purpose of the exercise was twofold: creating a relational database and executing queries.

The files included here are just the SQL scripts from these exercises.  There is one file (at the top) that is not a part of the example library project; but I included it here as an example of a stored procedure.

### Content Descriptions:
* C7_Sec2_Ex5.sql
    * stored procedure example
    * this was created for use with the AdventureWorks2008R2 sample database

* __C7_Sec2_Ex9_Queries.sql__
    * SQL Queries on the practice library database
    * These are my SQL statements as solutions to the queries outlined in the Drill requirements (see PDF file below)
* __C7_Sec2_Ex9v2.sql__
    * SQL Script to create the practice library database
    * This is populated with random and junk data to make the queries meaningful
* __SQL_Drill.pdf__
